'''
Completed script for NSO Training Day 2 Lab 4

Your goal in this lab is to learn how to iterate through the list objects
and manipulate large sets of NSO objects.

Step 1:
    Run the main function and see the outputted data.

Step 2:
    For any GigabitEthernet interface with a "2" digit in the interface ID
    and already has an assigned vlan, change the data vlan to 2.
    For example, Gi1/0/2, Gi1/0/20, Gi2/0/1 would all be in scope to be
    modified. If the vlan is None, ignore it.

Step 3:
    Complete the audit function so that it returns a list of interface IDs
    that belong to vlan 2.
