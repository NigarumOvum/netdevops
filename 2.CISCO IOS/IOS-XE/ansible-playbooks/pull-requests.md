# Pull Request Information 

DevNet is all about the community, and the Sandboxes and code samples are no different.  If you've expanded on one of our examples, fixed a bug, or created something totally new we'd love to include it in this repository for other developers to leverage.  

## Guidelines

In an effort to make contributing easier, and make sure pull requests are accepted without too much trouble, we've assembled this basic list of guidelines.  

1. Within the repository are folders for [ansible-playbooks](ansible-playbooks), [guestshel](guestshell), [other](other), etc for organizing sample code.  Place your code in whichever folder fits your example the closest.  
    * Create a sub-folder with a name that describes your example to help maintain order within the code repo
1. Update the README.md within the technology folder (ie [ansible-playbooks/README.md](ansible-playbooks/README.md)) 
    * Add details on your new example to the end of the file 
    * Add an entry within the "Quick Links" section at the top with your example title and a link to your new content 
1. If your example has dependencies, include setup details and information needed to use your example.  
    * For example, if you are contributing a Python script, include a `requirements.txt` file with your script indicating what modules are required.
